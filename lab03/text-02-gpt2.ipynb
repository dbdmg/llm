These models do not have an encoder to process the entire input at once. Instead, they use **autoregressive** generation, predicting the next token based on the preceding context.\n",

    "### 1. **Embeddings Layer**\n",
    "The embeddings layer creates initial representations of the input tokens, encoding both the meaning of the words and their positions within the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Word Embeddings** (`wte`): Maps each of the 50,257 vocabulary tokens into a 768-dimensional vector space.\n",
    "- **Position Embeddings** (`wpe`): Adds positional information to the tokens using a learned embedding of size 1024 (representing the maximum sequence length) with 768 dimensions. This allows the model to understand the order of the tokens, as transformers do not have an inherent sense of position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Transformer Block (Decoder)**\n",
    "The core of GPT-2 is composed of 12 identical **transformer blocks**, each consisting of several sub-components. These blocks are stacked to process the input text in a sequential, autoregressive manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each transformer block includes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Layer Normalization (ln_1, ln_2)**: Normalization is applied before both the attention mechanism and the feed-forward network to stabilize and speed up training. It ensures that the inputs to the layers have the same mean and variance, using learned parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-Attention Mechanism**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Self-Attention Mechanism (attn)**: GPT-2 uses masked self-attention to ensure that the model can only attend to tokens that have already been processed, preventing the model from \"seeing\" future tokens. This makes the model autoregressive.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Query, Key, Value Projections**: The attention mechanism computes the **query (Q)**, **key (K)**, and **value (V)** vectors using **Conv1D layers** (`c_attn`). Notice that (1) when the kernel size is 1, the role of Conv1d is just to do a linear projection, and (2) that under the hood, the Conv1d used in HuggingFace is indeed just a linear projection (see code [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/53fad641cfdb5105e2470bcf3ef17ea8e25cc300/src/transformers/pytorch_utils.py#L87)). In other words, `c_attn` performs a linear transformation and covers the role of $W_q$, $W_k$, and $W_v$. All other operations using Conv1d will follow the same principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Attention Output**: The output of the attention layer is passed through another **Conv1D layer** (`c_proj`) to project it back to the original 768-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feed-Forward Neural Network (mlp)**\n",
    "Each transformer block also contains a fully connected feed-forward neural network that processes the output of the attention mechanism. This is done in two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **First Linear Transformation (`c_fc`)**: Expands the dimensionality from 768 to a larger intermediate size using a **Conv1D layer**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - **Activation Function (`act`)**: Applies the **GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit)** activation function, which introduces non-linearity and helps the model capture complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Second Linear Transformation (`c_proj`)**: Projects the output back down from the intermediate size to 768 dimensions using another **Conv1D layer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Residual Connections**\n",
    "  - GPT-2 uses skip connections around both the self-attention and feed-forward layers, where the input to each sub-layer is added to its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Final Layer Normalization and Language Modeling Head**\n",
    "- After passing through all 12 transformer blocks, a final **LayerNorm** (`ln_f`) is applied to normalize the output before it is passed to the language modeling head for token prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The output of the final transformer block is passed through a **linear layer** (`lm_head`) which maps the 768-dimensional hidden states to the vocabulary size (50,257). This step is essential for converting the hidden representations into predictions for the next token in the sequence.\n"
