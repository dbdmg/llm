They are used in Agile software development to capture the user’s needs and goals in a way that prioritizes functionality and value. A typical user story follows the format:\n","\n","\"As a [type of user], I want [a specific goal] so that [reason or benefit].\"\n","\n","This format ensures the focus stays on delivering solutions that meet the user’s expectations. User stories guide development by defining clear, actionable tasks for teams while remaining flexible and open to adaptation as the project evolves.\n","\n","Our objective is to create an agent architecture like the following one:\n","\n","1. **Problem Specification (Domain Specification):**\n","The process begins with the definition of a problem description, which outlines the domain or context of the system. This serves as the input to the LLM and sets the foundation for generating user stories. Our problem specification is provided as the input to the process.\n","\n","2. **Role(s) Extraction (\"Who\" Aspect):**\n","A prompt is used to extract roles from the problem description.\n","Roles represent the different types of users or stakeholders involved in the system This step answers \"who\" the user stories are about.\n","\n","3. **Function(s) Extraction (\"What\" Aspect):**\n","Another prompt is used to extract functions associated with each role.\n","Functions describe the specific actions or goals the roles aim to perform within the system. This step answers \"what\" the users want to achieve.\n","\n","4. **Purpose(s) Extraction (\"Why\" Aspect):**\n","A subsequent prompt is used to determine the purposes behind the functions identified. Purposes explain the reasons or motivations behind the desired actions of the roles. This step answers \"why\" the users need the functions.\n","\n","5. **User Stories Generation:**\n","Combining the roles (who), functions (what), and purposes (why), a final prompt generates complete user stories. These user stories take the standard Agile format: \"As a \\<who\\>, I want \\<what\\>, so that \\<why\\>.\"\n","\n","**Prompt Chain**:\n","The process is iterative, as each step informs the next and ensures that the roles, functions, and purposes are fully aligned. The LLM is guided by a structured \"prompt chain,\" where prompts are carefully designed to extract specific information at each stage.\n","\n","**Output**:\n","The final output consists of user stories that capture the needs and goals of the system's users in a concise, actionable format. These stories guide development teams in implementing the desired features and functionalities.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":667,"referenced_widgets":["9b618c9a31ed429c8af8b11860eacd6d","a0b16547e9004d7c93176c7b14d0a787","6ac4701c9157425db1d23ec097352bd5","8a9e279d07b2459891ced64f0b1bd3a8","081aafe77a3547aa8b9fd83e520fa8d2","e5b476331591413d80b98b0aa46f831e","4271538613b34cd8bfc1a8c607ee7927","5a0c0725dd51424097783734088f0ee3","d0a89ac35f3f4e8bb986f9b6828e0c3b","70c6130c85394c7ab99e1fec75651393","b761ca92c08e4528852f1baf27fd4d84","beb6f1522695483ba0f50e050b98edf8","a081b2055f5a4ccfbbce77394df8161f","ecfcee6215c24cb2bfa1807644e51189","56dec7df8d3b4ffc9dafc0ac822c46db","7ccd72170a244f9aa08f92c02f9d423f","abe3c657f61a4f7791d111b128efdea5","ee19d2aac62849dd9abecb6f865b6c7f","d313e8cf6cc94b059ece6db5c7f8d521","7e72c1ad95394e198b686f89e33ea0ca","eeaaf7aa7612407d818b78555031140f","62e8257bf1654abebcdb8208a66a506b","3cdf367844764a33bae618bec0a05b84","eb73f0e3cd2f41b4b2116612fcfeecb9","cc67f5f51d9f437a8db4eb177db62520","31e302beeb1f44e290c8305babd33f76","9d561e3f6c374baebfbc5d2a6491ce1e","5dffe4299a664f158a3cc85064743201","3a8c6ec579ef438492526646d2cd21c3","4c17e056e2c94d50a63de0688f13a5d0","4594acd911ab4f71b6254116f97d123c","69949a6cce0149278d22424e923ff0d6","54e6c64c16f44230b9846fac551fbbc7","95cc7f2f2e284a0e8a083222ab8d95ce","22ec444c5a014fe8bf386f8b5f57ff16","1f1232aba2e84e1f9715493ec8227a96","110c2202392646d9ad6ef61143e99d70","b0eeb2a1a58346d4b3d6154be4f31e69","85c5580d2e5e4a728dfa8def71644dc4","ad16affba1b84489b9609546b6b6e91e","9a6a3bcb9d234f3b813cf18250c76ecf","4639b89362f54d8eaa13c21d787beaab","69c4ae9e08aa475db806ba4447b4cbd1","a4b7a7ca95a644a6a57468224c4cbaa8","bc5e24526c244a6f8ed1ce7c7d1f630c","f9373850a61b4f9f8f00065b577effd0","32a5073fa16a4929b551269c9edfd193","b517298a7c0a47b4b4a50603ece452ee","fac039774e484b3984d63ae85f063f94","71b435d26bbe425094afd1c33ca63c12","a43198902cd54bc9804fe1eb6ef770f0","b7f79bda8b174df89870ac145c7d8f96","706a025fabf940118062a4459c8890ac","514d196a08c94fecbcd496da3f34b71d","107d9293c2324a49b0d31ed0242711b1","c173f3c9c5d54298b6a816e337ea89b6","30f0dd36875e4a388edfc963a6a9b9bd","e2e37865dee74bbb963e174aa8281d31","9c094c91885c479b904b7a5d9722d438","b98cbb880f1c4e5880aaab6cbe8a45b6","1d67116c22224a62b037347e92f32dc7","c27c04244d5245d89c0b9449db44c817","b5d318c56d004a61afb4808b04a3ca9a","4d2660636fd9490c882c7ad871a8a1e5","2d26c469ba5042d3b8f76f68294bbc04","12c500ab387e474baef16d0998af44c6","3005d2ec99774aac9405bcd45de4c286","8bb1c960961a42c6b26ee6dd31d1ed41","369fefe52e3f4ff3bbfd086417f69338","0e91c9d1c51a473e8aea1da2fcd4fb46","d32fa3b73b3b413db1a9cd206c4f7051","ffaf2ab6ab53406e8e7cf4ed9c6735bb","8f1a7d062c5f45e994074e904e4027f5","a54bf8ec6087436aa63af75169652d10","0ca4704553344475af636b3aa1c17450","ce32bc4e78f541d6895f05e17ec24f6b","f5a437a7b9c943059ed31e99a5ec88ca","37d9db3f7d0d4f81891d82429a2a8925","42184b4e82d74780aef1f106e1380c81","23927e7a23f843c9b77d26ab305bbac7","f66faa3627494864b51180fb43e24f24","15590837366d4fc0b7bd48aacbc1557b","9c15291668ca4c8d9efa2aef054725d0","a9368aa272864cdda1551677dbb5db31","e2fd5b37474f4618a5d31cb135b8b37a","129532acce24498f8311eec4de77b34a","1bcfc719aade40a4807967756d4b1957","41986e1aeb2f4699ada64d262d5d6c19","fa99a9e440254531904897960850a99f","36f289c338474909940893600c31beb4","251aaa0eb158414e9d407b64377161e7","9fa556b7f02d43128013d19408f7624d","2c8f5cdf4f6b44e98270769a167872ac","90ca36d6afe44ea1bccd759563d61c30","75a73d4309a9416b991b3046c19864fd","1766c246cb7e45f5aebad0c9c30deeff","8b175be1330b4d5fa07f8b13815bda4e","6dda7038da054b90be11cdb8d1c77fa9","5aaf177e693143feacf0dd5def1bb0e6","faa59e66ca9a43f6aed4bc91398c205c","b0a1e4fed20e496d824d0cd9ae6f854f","21decb5e6b7f4cb2898943f317120390","93a76112b4e7488e9631327d16d4b235","cd7f738919184dbcab0cd169d7be52af","accfb8f79770433c852e6bf863b13b29","c640cdf4d18a4874a6bc1867859ee03b","9ddd779ab1f84e528e8f157cdfa547e1","a4dfae117bb549718855446b7e1682e3","d2eb0d1a763d490d82f9249d5ba1de88","25dfee99306f4c4eadb29ae7bff00d47"]},"id":"hL2Z-R9s3uXY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764074559478,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":169025,"user":{"displayName":"anna arnaudo","userId":"15108618421102072944"}},"outputId":"947d21d8-3e8f-4b5e-c175-4f65bd341467"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/878 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"9b618c9a31ed429c8af8b11860eacd6d"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["`torch_dtype` is deprecated!

The platform provides a centralized repository of hiking routes, hut information, and parking facilities. It also enables interactive features such as real-time hike tracking, personalized recommendations, and group hike planning. By combining these capabilities, the platform seeks to foster safe, informed, and collaborative hiking experiences.\\\n","The platform will be deployed as a cloud-based web and mobile application accessible to all stakeholders. The distribution strategy includes an app available on major mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, alongside a responsive web interface. It will require an internet connection for features like real-time tracking, notifications, and user authentication, though some offline capabilities, such as pre-downloaded hike information, will also be available.\\\n","User authentication will be role-based, ensuring that only authorized users, such as verified hut workers and platform managers, can access sensitive or administrative features.\\\n","Visitors are the primary users of the platform. They can browse a comprehensive list of hiking trails, filter them based on specific criteria such as difficulty, length, or starting point, and view detailed descriptions. To access advanced features like personalized recommendations, visitors can create user accounts by registering on the platform. Registered users can record their fitness parameters, enabling the system to suggest trails tailored to their capabilities.\\\n","During a hike, visitors can record their progress by marking reference points and sharing their live location through a broadcasting URL. They can also initiate group activities by planning hikes, adding group members, and confirming group participation. The platform allows visitors to start, terminate, and track their hikes, with notifications for unfinished hikes or late group members to ensure safety and accountability.\\\n","Local guides enrich the platform by contributing essential information. They can add detailed descriptions of hikes, parking facilities, and huts, ensuring hikers have accurate and comprehensive data. Local guides also link parking lots and huts to specific trails as starting or arrival points, enhancing the planning process.\\\n","To aid in the visual representation and accessibility of information, local guides can upload pictures of huts and connect these locations directly to hikes. This integration simplifies route planning and helps visitors visualize their journey.\\\n","Platform managers oversee the operational integrity and safety of the platform. They verify new hut worker registrations, ensuring that only authorized personnel can update hut-related data. Managers can also broadcast weather alerts for specific areas, notifying all hikers in those regions through push notifications. This ensures that users stay informed about potentially hazardous conditions.\\\n","The platform manager's role includes maintaining an organized and secure user system while facilitating collaboration between local guides, hut workers, and visitors.\\\n","Hut workers are critical to the maintenance of up-to-date trail and accommodation information. After registering and being verified, hut workers can log into the platform to add or update information about their assigned huts, including uploading pictures and describing the facilities available. They can also monitor and report on the condition of nearby trails, ensuring hikers receive current information.\\\n","Hut workers play a vital role in providing situational updates for hikers. For instance, if a nearby trail is impacted by severe weather or physical obstructions, they can communicate these conditions through the platform. This enhances the safety and preparedness of all hikers relying on the platform.\"\n","\n","\n","from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n","from huggingface_hub import login\n","import torch\n","\n","#----------------Google Colab only---------------------\n","from google.colab import userdata\n","login(userdata.get('HF_TOKEN'))\n","#----------------Google Colab only---------------------\n","\n","#detect the device available\n","device = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n","\n","# Load the tokenizer and model\n","model_id = \"meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct\"\n","model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map=device).to(device)\n","tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\n","\n","\n","# We define a method to ask any prompt to llama\n","def make_a_query(prompt: str, max_new_tokens:int = 200):\n","  \"\"\"\n","    Send a prompt to the Llama model and get a response.\n","\n","    Args:\n","    - prompt (str): The input question or statement to the model.\n","    - max_new_tokens (int): The maximum length of the response.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","    - str: The model's generated response.\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    # Both the tokenizer and the model are global variables\n","\n","    # Set pad_token_id if missing\n","    if tokenizer.pad_token_id is None:\n","        tokenizer.pad_token_id = tokenizer.eos_token_id\n","\n","\n","    # Tokenize the input with padding and truncation\n","    device = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n","    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True, truncation=True).to(device)\n","\n","    # Compute the lenght of the input prompt to be able to extract the model's response later\n","    input_ids = inputs[\"input_ids\"]\n","    prompt_length = input_ids.shape[1]\n","\n","    # Generate a response\n","    output = model.generate(\n","        inputs['input_ids'],\n","        attention_mask=inputs['attention_mask'],\n","        max_new_tokens=max_new_tokens,  # Limit the number of new tokens generated (e.g., a single word)\n","        #temperature=0.3,  # Reduce randomness, use with do_sample = True\n","        repetition_penalty=2.0,  # Penalize repetition\n","        no_repeat_ngram_size=3,  # Avoid repeating bigrams\n","        do_sample= False,  # Set to False to use Greedy or Beam search\n","        num_beams=3, # Use with do_sample = False\n","        eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,  # End generation at EOS token\n","        pad_token_id=tokenizer.pad_token_id,  # Avoid padding tokens\n","        early_stopping=True,\n","    )\n","\n","    generated_tokens = output[0, prompt_length:]\n","\n","    # Decode the response into human-readable text\n","    response = tokenizer.decode(generated_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True).strip()\n","\n","    return response\n","\n","#---------------------Example usage - without chat template------------------\n","prompt = \"\"\"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n","You are an expert on world capitals.\n","Respond with only the capital city of the given country.
