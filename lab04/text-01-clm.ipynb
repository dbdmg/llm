    "In this lab, we will explore **Causal Language Modeling (CLM)**, which is a core task in training autoregressive language models like GPT-2. CLM is the process of predicting the next word in a sequence, given the previous words. This type of modeling forms the backbone of text generation tasks, where the model learns to generate coherent text by focusing only on previous tokens in the sequence.\n",
