CLM is the process of predicting the next word in a sequence, given the previous words. This type of modeling forms the backbone of text generation tasks, where the model learns to generate coherent text by focusing only on previous tokens in the sequence.\n",

This way, the model only has to pad the sequences to the length of the longest sequence in each group, which can significantly reduce the amount of padding required.\n",
