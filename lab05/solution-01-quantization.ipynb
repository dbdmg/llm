    "### **Introduction to Quantization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization is a process used to reduce the memory requirements and computational complexity of large machine learning models. By representing model parameters with lower-precision values, quantization makes it possible to run models more efficiently on devices with limited memory and computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "For large language models (LLMs), quantization can:\n",
    "- **Reduce Memory Usage:** Lower-precision data types (such as int8) use less memory than higher-precision types (like float32), allowing models to fit into memory-constrained environments.\n",
    "- **Improve Inference Speed:** By using simpler operations on smaller data types, quantization can reduce the time it takes for a model to process inputs and generate outputs.\n",
    "- **Preserve Accuracy:** Quantization is carefully designed to minimize the impact on model accuracy, though a trade-off often exists between precision and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), a quantization technique that applies quantization to a pre-trained model. PTQ is a popular method for quantizing large language models because it can be applied to a wide range of models that we may want to use in inference mode. By contrast, quantization-aware training (QAT) requires retraining the model with quantization in mind, which can be more complex and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first get a general understanding of quantization by manually implementing two commonly adopted approaches: absmax and minmax (or zero-point). \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will explore two different ways (one using PyTorch, the other using HuggingFace) to run a **dynamic quantization** (i.e., PTQ where only the weights are quantized, and not the activations). "
